Thank you for buying the SELF source code! We really appreciate your support on the game.

We are planning on working on a larger version of the game, so please respect that by not using the 
source code to clone/replicate the game. Feel free to use the code as a reference for your own games,
but don't use it to mod/expand the game. 

Once again, thank you <3.
